# Mental-Health-Survey-EDA
The project analyzes a mental health survey conducted in the tech industry to explore attitudes, awareness, and the prevalence of mental health issues in the workplace. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examine how different factors such as company size, remote work, availability of mental health resources.

# Business Insights
The primary business objective of this project is to help organizations—particularly those in the tech industry—identify key workplace factors that influence employee mental health and their willingness to seek treatment. By analyzing survey responses from tech workers across various age groups, job roles, and company types, we aimed to uncover patterns related to mental health awareness, company support systems, and employee behavior. Our analysis revealed that factors such as family history of mental illness, ease of taking medical leave, and the presence of wellness programs significantly affect whether employees seek help. Companies that offer clear mental health benefits, ensure anonymity, and actively promote mental wellness initiatives see higher engagement and better treatment-seeking behavior among employees. Conversely, lack of awareness, perceived stigma, and unstructured leave policies discourage employees from addressing mental health issues.

# Recommendations
To meet the business objective of fostering a mentally healthy workplace, I recommend the client take a multi-layered approach:

Enhance Awareness and Communication: Conduct regular workshops, webinars, or newsletters to educate employees on mental health and available support.

Improve Access to Resources: Provide easy and confidential access to therapy, counseling, and wellness tools via internal platforms or third-party partnerships.

Integrate Mental Health into HR Policy: Make mental health part of performance reviews, onboarding processes, and wellness KPIs.

Train Managers and Supervisors: Equip team leads to recognize early signs of distress and support employees without judgment.

Promote Equal Treatment of Physical and Mental Health: Ensure insurance, leave policies, and workplace culture reflect equal importance.

Monitor and Measure: Collect regular anonymous feedback and track engagement with wellness resources to make data-driven improvements.

By implementing these actions, the client can create a more open, supportive culture that not only helps employees thrive but also reduces absenteeism, increases productivity, and boosts retention.

# Problem Statement
Despite increasing awareness about mental health, many employees in the tech industry still face stigma, lack of support, and insufficient resources in the workplace. Employers often struggle to identify the right indicators or initiatives that can truly help employees manage mental health effectively. There is a pressing need to understand how workplace factors correlate with mental health outcomes to guide policies and interventions.

# Business Objective

Provide insights into how companies can better support employee mental health through policies, wellness programs, and open communication.

Enable data-driven decision-making for HR departments and company leadership to foster a healthier, more productive work environment.
